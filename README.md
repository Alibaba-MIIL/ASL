**Abstract**

> Pictures of everyday life are inherently multi-label in nature. Hence,
> multi-label classification is commonly used to analyze their content.
> In typical multi-label datasets, each picture contains only a few
> positive labels, and many negative ones. This positive-negative
> imbalance can result in under-emphasizing gradients from positive
> labels during training, leading to poor accuracy. In this paper,
> we introduce a novel asymmetric loss ("ASL"), that operates
> differently on positive and negative samples. The loss dynamically
> down-weights the importance of easy negative samples, causing the
> optimization process to focus more on the positive samples, and also
> enables to discard mislabeled negative samples. We demonstrate how ASL
> leads to a more "balanced" network, with increased average
> probabilities for positive samples, and show how this balanced network
> is translated to better mAP scores, compared to commonly used losses.
> Furthermore, we offer a method that can dynamically adjust the level
> of asymmetry throughout the training. With ASL, we reach new
> state-of-the-art results on three common multi-label datasets,
> including achieving $86.6\%$ on MS-COCO. We also demonstrate ASL
> applicability for other tasks such as fine-grain single-label
> classification and object detection. ASL is effective, easy to
> implement, and does not increase the training time or complexity

## ASL Implementation
In this PyTorch [file](\src\loss_functions\losses.py), we provide two
implementation of ASL, that can serve as a drop-in replacement for
standard loss functions (Cross-Entropy and Focal-Loss)

The two implementations are: 
- ```class AsymmetricLoss(nn.Module)```
- ```class AsymmetricLossOptimized(nn.Module)``` <br>

The two losses are bit-accurate. However, ``` AsymmetricLossOptimized```
contains a more optimized (and complicated) way of implementing ASL,
which minimizes memory allocation gpu uploading, and favors inplace
operations.

## Pretrained Models
In this [file](MODEL_ZOO.md), we provide pre-trained models on various
datasets. 

## Inference Code
We provide [inference code](infer.py), that demonstrate how to load our
model, pre-process an image and do actuall inference. This code can also
serve as a template for validating our mAP scores. Example run of
MS-COCO model (after downloading the relevant model):
```
python -m -infer.py  \
--dataset_type=MS-COCO \
--model_name=tresnet_l \
--model_path=./models_local/MS_COCO_TRresNet_L_448_86.6.pth \
--pic_path=./pics/000000000885.jpg \
--input_size=448
```
which will result in:

  </tr>
</table>
</p>

Example run of
OpenImages model (after downloading the relevant model):
```
python -m -infer.py  \
--dataset_type=OpenImages \
--model_name=tresnet_l \
--model_path=./models_local/Open_ImagesV6_TRresNet_L_448.pth \
--pic_path=./pics/000000000885.jpg \
--input_size=448
```
<p align="center">
 <table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-c3ow"><img src="./pics/example_inference_open_images.jpeg" align="center" width="600" ></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>
